## Requirements
* Python 3.7.3
* Please install other pakeages by 
``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage Example
* Running one trial on Cora:
```sh run_cora.sh ```
* Running 100 trials with random initializations on Cora:
```sh run100_cora.sh ```
* Calculating the average accuracy of 100 trails on Cora:
```python result_100run.py cora ```

## Results

Our model achieves the following accuracies on Cora, CiteSeer and Pubmed with the public splits:

| Model name   |   Cora    |  CiteSeer |  Pubmed   |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| GRAND        |   85.4%   |    75.4%  |   82.7%   |

## Running Environment 

The experimental results reported in paper are conducted on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti with CUDA 10.0, which might be slightly inconsistent with the results induced by other platforms.
